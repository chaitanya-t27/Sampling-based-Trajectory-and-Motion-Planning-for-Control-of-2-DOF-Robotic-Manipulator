# Sampling-based-Trajectory-and-Motion-Planning-for-Control-of-2-DOF-Robotic-Manipulator
Executed a sampling based motion and trajectory planning algorithm based on the RRT* algorithm using Inverse and Forward kinematics  on a 2 DOF robotic manipulator to successfully trace multiple waypoints while avoiding body collision with surrounding obstacles
